# #FeministHackerBarbie Website Code
I wanted to share the code behind the website, in case you #FeministHackerBarbie ignited your curiosity about programming! Or about building Django web apps or image manipulation in the browser! It's all here... take a look. 

### Setup
This app uses Django 1.7 and Python 2.7. The live version references a database I host elsewhere, but this code here uses a local Sqlite database.
